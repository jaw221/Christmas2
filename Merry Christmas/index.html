      <h2>A letter from me to you.</h2>
      <p>Hey kaila, It's been almost 9 months since our friendship started!! and you've been the best thing that's happened to me this year, I'm glad that I have someone as amazing and caring as you as my friend. Thank you for always being there for me in my time of need.
        Our friendship's had bumps here and there but it's a friendship that I hope will last for a very long time. You're one of the people I wish to keep close to me for as long as I possible can. You're an amazing friend and an incredibly sweet person too.
        No matter what you say about you being annoying, Trust me. You aren't annoying. I find it sweet and cute when you yap and talk about your interests, You seem super excited to show off what you like and I admire that quality of yours, Dont ever lose it.
         Your presence is quite soothing and makes my day better (trust me) and I could not hope for a better person to be there in my time of need other than you. You've helped me through so much it's insane. I cant do anything but thank you and be grateful for such a kind and caring friend. Merry Christmas Kaila. I hope you like this website. </p>
